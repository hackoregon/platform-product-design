# Hack Oregon Platform Vision

## **Problem Statement**

Hack Oregon currently does not have a platform on which to empower citizens, volunteers, and government decision makers to easily interact with open data.

Current tools lack reusable and scalable components, functional APIs, and curated datasets to facilitate the creation of engaging data stories that transform public information into public knowledge.

By building a modular data insights platform we will ultimately create an authentic, inclusive, and branded resource that helps people make informed decisions.

## **Why we&#39;re building it**

To showcase the power of open data and to cultivate new prosperous relationships among Hack Oregon, community organizations and citizens alike.

### **Our Values**

Accessibility

Accuracy

Authenticity

Curiosity

Discoverability

Engagement

Inclusion

Details

40 y/o Public Information Officer for Portland Fire and Rescue.  As Public Information Officer, Maria develops visual reports to communicate and advocate for Fire &amp; Rescue actions and needs. Accuracy of the data presented is crucial, but in some ways more importantly, the data needs to be providing the right message.

Still, she&#39;s curious about opening data for public use to help engage the public. She would want to see the ideas before signing off on its usage. Getting some free help processing the data is also tempting with her limited budget. And it would be nice to provide the other departments with some tools to manage their data.

Aptitude

- Basic word processing and email skills.`

Attitude

- Skeptical of the value of open data. Worried about accuracy.

# Proto-Persona for Nancy Ramirez - Hack Oregon Volunteer - 35

Problem Statement

&quot;I want to be a productive member of a team who has the ability to quickly assemble curated data centric stories to empower users to develop informed opinions&quot;

Snapshot

- Data Science volunteer for Hack Oregon
- Wants to showcase the value she can add through her mathematics skills
- Interested in picking up new skills and developing her network
- Passionate about using her professional skills for the public good
- Needs established patterns to aid her in creating her stories.

Details

- 35 y/o high school math teacher
- Interested in developing her data science skills to help explain and energize her students about real world applications of math
- Shy until she&#39;s talking about her interest areas. Wants opportunities to network.

Nancy loves math in all its forms, but she has especially seen the power of practical applications to get her students excited. She learned about Hack Oregon from one of her graduates who is a current volunteer.

She feels she doesn&#39;t have time to contribute much with a busy schedule, but would still like to learn some skills to bring back to her class.

She also wants to meet others - she has trouble making friends who are interested in data and math. Though she&#39;s shy about the prospect (she prefers lecturing to a group to one-on-one small talk) she&#39;s willing to push her boundaries to try something new.



Ability

- Nancy has had mildly poor vision since childhood. She doesn&#39;t like wearing contacts or glasses in public, so tends to &quot;deal with it&quot; until she gets a migraine; as such, she doesn&#39;t like to spend extended periods in front of a computer in public.

Aptitude

- Extremely strong abstract math skills.
- Some programming experience.

Attitude

- Excited about helping people learn.
- Passionate about bringing practical applications of data to the general public
- Nervous to talk about things outside of her comfort zone, but wants to network.
